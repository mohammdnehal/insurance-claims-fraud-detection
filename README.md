Machine Learning project to detect fraudulent insurance claims
# üõ°Ô∏è Insurance Claim Fraud Detection

This project aims to detect fraudulent insurance claims using machine learning models. By preprocessing real-world data and training multiple classifiers, the project identifies patterns that help distinguish between genuine and fraudulent claims.

---

## üöÄ Project Objectives

- Predict whether an insurance claim is fraudulent.
- Preprocess and encode real-world insurance data.
- Handle class imbalance using SMOTE.
- Compare multiple machine learning models for performance.

---

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)

## üìÇ Dataset

- File: `insurance_fraud_large.csv`
- Size: Large dataset with insurance claim records.
- Target Column: `fraud_reported` (Yes/No)

> *Note: The dataset is expected to be in the `data/` folder. If you're running this notebook, make sure the CSV file path is correct.*

## üìä Results

| Model              | F1 Score |
|-------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.67     |
| Random Forest       | 0.74     |
| XGBoost             | 0.81     |

XGBoost outperforms other models with the highest F1 Score, making it the best candidate for detecting fraud in this case.
